## 💡 About Me

🎓 I’m currently a learner in the <strong>ALX Front-End Development Program</strong>, building a solid foundation in software engineering and web technologies.  

🌱 I'm deeply passionate about using code to create accessible learning tools that empower graduates whose skills don’t match current industry demands — especially in the tech space.  

🚀 My long-term goal: to become a proficient <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> in the next 2 years and launch a mobile & web-based offline learning app focused on practical, industry-aligned tech skills.
